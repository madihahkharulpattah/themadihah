              Now, I am looking for my first full-time job. 
              I have been working as a freelance graphic designer for the last two years.</td>

          <td>The world is changing rapidly, and I cannot say with confidence where I see myself in five years because 
            I donâ€™t have enough professional experience to be certain about such things. 
            However, I have an interest in creating the most accessible and versatile designs for use on the web and in print.

          <td>I also know that I can provide a fresh take and an extraordinary approach to every project. 
            I am always open to challenges and constructive feedback. 
            I am open-minded and learn new things quickly. 
            I will dedicate all my skills and talents to develop high-quality and unique products.
            I look forward to more opportunities working with people around the world, sharing the same interests with me.
